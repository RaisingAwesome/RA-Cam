    <p>Raising Awesome is just the Maker Team name we came up with for our contests on the internet.  We are a father and son maker
    team that have been chasing projects for over ten years together.</p>
    <p>What's cool about this project is that everything, including the ASP.Net Core 5 website you are viewing now, is running on a Raspberry Pi Zero W!
